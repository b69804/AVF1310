                    1. Twitter can be used for logins and payments in a few different ways.  Instead of having someone <br>create an entirely new username and password for your app, you can allow them to login with <br>their Twitter info.  This can allow you to easily be able to post info about what your doing in <br>the app to Twitter.  One of those things that you could be doing in your app is purchasing <br>items or services.  Because you are already logged into Twitter, your user can easily share <br>info about those purchases to Twitter.  This increases exposure and shows that people are using <br>your app.  I know, personally, that if I see one of my friends using an app, I am more inclined <br>to try it out.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. We need JSON-P specifically for this class because we are trying to get information from a different <br>domain.  We have to be able to use the results that we get from a different domain in a way <br>that fits best for our app.  Normally, when you make a JSON request to a different domain, the <br>data that you get back is often not in a format that you can do something with it.  With JSON-<br>P, you are allowed to add a special parameter to your domain call that allows the data that you <br>get back to be in a format that you can use more effectively.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Some of the more popular websites allow JSONP requests.  Not every major website allows for JSONP <br>requests, but sites like Instagram, Flickr, foursquare, bit.ly, Vimeo, and Dropbox do.  Native <br>features like the camera and geolocation would pair perfectly with Instagram and Flickr.  The <br>Media and Contacts features would pair nicely with Dropbox or Vimeo because you could share your <br>media with Dropbox, or share Vimeo results with your contacts.  foursquare really only works <br>with geolocation because that is what the foursquare service is all about.  Storage is also one <br>that would work well with Dropbox.  You could allow your user to save either to local storage <br>or to a service like Dropbox.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. I think this month I want to keep it simple and focus mainly on the camera and geolocation features.  <br>I want to be able to upload pictures to either Flickr or Instagram, and also allow for the <br>geolocation of each photo to be obtained.  I think also trying to implement foursquare <br>functionality would also be fun to explore.  If those do not pan out, I would like to try to get <br>media from Vimeo and allow those results to be filtered.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. The biggest “lesson learned” from past classes is that I would focus too much on design first, <br>rather than functionality.  I would spend too much time on how things looked or the layout of <br>information, and then run out of time for what the project or assignment was actually about.  I <br>have tried to change my approach now to get basic design done first, then add all <br>functionality, then finally, fine-tune and clean up the design.<br>

                       1. The very first thing I need to do is add ALT tags to my images.  I am terrible at remembering to <br>add those into my images and I did not even think about how they could be related to <br>accessibility.  I also need to increase the contrast of the elements in my Demo App.  I <br>would imagine that someone with some visual disabilities would have a hard time <br>distinguishing the buttons and links in my app.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                       2. It looks like that majority of frustrations that arise from both screen readers and mobile screen <br>readers tend to be about inaccessible Flash Content.  Flash content gets skipped over by a <br>lot of the readers and that can be very confusing for the user.  Other frustrations are <br>CAPTCHA verifications are not accessible, links and buttons do not make sense, image <br>descriptions do not make sense, and complex forms are not understood.  A lot of these <br>problems and frustrations stem from the designer of the website not thinking about people <br>with accessibility needs when designing.  I know that it was not something I thought about <br>when making my Demo app.  Having proper HTML markup and proper ALT tags help solve some of <br>these issues.  Other ones can be embedding your videos into HTML and using the most up-to-<br>date CAPTCHA’s that have accessibility support.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        3. There are numerous devices available for people to use that have accessibility needs.  There are <br>braille keyboards available for people with vision disabilities.  These keyboards are <br>exactly like a normal keyboard, except the keys have braille on them.  Another device is <br>desktop video magnifier.  While these devices can be very expensive, they are a great <br>addition to anyone with low-vision.  They basically show a magnified image of whatever is <br>placed on the device.  This make for reading books or magazines much easier.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                       4. Two apps that greatly aide in accessibility are Dragon Dictate and Fleksy.  Dragon Dictate is a <br>text reader and speech dictation software.  It will not only read what is on the screen, it <br>also allows you to take notes and write messages just by speaking  Fleksy is a very easy to <br>use messenger.  It simplifies and enlarges the keyboard to make it very easier to see.  It <br>also put a different background on the text to make it easier to see the contrast.  Now while <br>these apps are great, iOS 7 has some amazing accessibility features built right into it.  <br>These include voice dictation with Siri, larger text options, assistive touch, motion <br>reduction, bolder text, and inverted colors.
